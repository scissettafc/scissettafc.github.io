        <h1>2018/19 Recap - Dave Iddon</h1>
        <img src="/img/news/dave-review.jpg">
        <p>It&rsquo;s a time for reflection as the end of my first season as Head Coach of Scissett FC draws to a close.</p>
        <p>At the start of the season I was well aware that the club had faced a tough few seasons prior to my appointment and it was time to consolidate and strengthen. Knowing I had the support of a fantastic chairman and my number 2 Matty gave me the confidence to implement the changes I felt needed to be made. At the beginning of the season morale was low and training started with only 4 attendees. I knew at this point we had an uphill battle to change the culture but I believed with good players who shared a commitment and drive to succeed, coupled with my consistency and experience, we could achieve great things.</p>
        <p>As expected there were a lot of changes in team selection, but with new players coming in and the return of some of the trusted &ldquo;old guard&rdquo; we soon got into our stride and winning ways followed.</p>
        <p>The season has been a huge learning curve for many players who now understand the commitment that is required by Matt and myself to ensure success. At times we have lacked discipline and we have disappointed ourselves by failing to shut down when we have taken the lead, but we have made monumental improvements and have never fallen below 5th in the league throughout the season.</p>
        <p>I am proud of all at the club as it was a huge achievement to finish 4th in the league and only one point off promotion. Reaching the final of the Groom Cup was also a pinnacle of the season and whilst we were disappointed with the result, it was an experience which will only serve to strengthen the resolve and determination of the team.</p>
        <p>The season ended with 26 players at training, a far cry for the lonely 4 that started the season with me! There&rsquo;s huge excitement and anticipation of the season ahead. The competition for squad places is on!</p>
        <p>I have no doubt that with the continued support of our chairman, the management, coaching staff and players, that Scissett FC is on the up and there are greater times ahead. I am committed to the club and it&rsquo;s future and I&rsquo;m proud to be its Head Coach.</p>
